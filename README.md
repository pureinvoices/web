## Developer Information

### Husky Pre-Commit Hooks

We have Husky set up to enforce pre-commit checks. These checks ensure that code and branch name is properly formatted before being committed.

### Commitlint

We use [Commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org/) to enforce conventional commit messages. This ensures that our commit history is readable and that semantic versioning can be applied.
